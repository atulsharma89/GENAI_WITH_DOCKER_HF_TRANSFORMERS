# ðŸš€ FastAPI-based NLP Application in Docker ðŸš€

This repository contains a FastAPI-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that is containerized using Docker. The goal of this project is to provide a robust and high-performance web API for NLP tasks, ensuring seamless deployment across different environments.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights

### FastAPI for High-Performance Web APIs
- Leveraged FastAPI to create a robust and high-performance web API for NLP tasks.
- The `app.py` script defines our application, enabling users to perform text processing efficiently.

### Containerization with Docker
- Created a Docker image to ensure the application runs seamlessly across different environments.
- The `Dockerfile` includes all necessary instructions to build the image, ensuring easy deployment and scalability.

### Comprehensive Dependency Management
- Used a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.
- Key dependencies include FastAPI, Requests, Uvicorn, SentencePiece, Torch, and Transformers, reflecting the application's advanced NLP capabilities.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

- **FastAPI Application**: The application utilizes FastAPI, known for its speed and ease of use, to handle HTTP requests and provide NLP functionalities.
- **NLP Models**: Integrated state-of-the-art NLP models from the Transformers library to perform text analysis and processing.
- **Deployment**: Dockerfile crafted to containerize the application, simplifying deployment in various environments, from local development to cloud-based platforms.

## ðŸ“‚ Key Files

- **`app.py`**: Contains the FastAPI application code.
- **`Dockerfile`**: Defines the environment for the application, including all dependencies and setup commands.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the Python packages required for the project.
